This app is useful to find the electricity consumption in a household on a daily basis and helps the user to find the total amount to be paid for the day after the deduction based on Gruha Jyoti Scheme
This app serves as a real-time energy management tool specifically designed for residents of Karnataka. By tracking daily usage and applying the specific logic of the **Gruha Jyothi Scheme**, it removes the guesswork from monthly utility bills.

Here is an elaboration on its key features and how the scheme’s logic is integrated:

---

### 1. Daily Consumption Tracking

The app allows users to monitor their electricity usage on a day-to-day basis. This is crucial because the Gruha Jyothi benefits are strictly capped at **200 units per month**.

* **Preventing Bill Shocks:** Users can see if they are approaching their personal "Free Unit" limit mid-month.
* **Appliance Insights:** By tracking daily spikes, users can identify which appliances (like ACs or geysers) are pushing them toward the taxable limit.

### 2. Gruha Jyothi Deduction Logic

The app doesn't just show units; it calculates the **subsidy** based on the Karnataka government's complex formula. The "Total Amount to be Paid" is calculated using three main scenarios:

| Scenario | Monthly Consumption | What the App Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Full Subsidy** | \le Your Entitlement Units* | **₹0 (Zero Bill)** |
| **Partial Subsidy** | > Entitlement but \le 200 Units | **Pay only for the extra units** |
| **No Subsidy** | > 200 Units | **Pay the FULL bill** (No subsidy applied) |

> **Note on Entitlement Units:** This is typically your average monthly consumption from FY 2022-23 plus a 10% buffer (or 10 extra units for low consumers as per the 2025 update).

### 3. Real-Time Financial Transparency

After the app records the daily units, it performs the following calculation to show the "Amount Due Today":

1. **Unit Check:** Determines if the current month’s projected total is within the user's registered Gruha Jyothi limit.
2. **Deduction Application:** Subtracts the "Free Units" from the total units consumed.
3. **Tariff Calculation:** Applies the current ESCOM (BESCOM, HESCOM, etc.) rates to any units *above* the entitlement.
4. **Fixed Charges:** Includes fixed costs and taxes that might still apply if the 200-unit limit is breached.

### 4. Why This is Useful

* **For Tenants:** Since the scheme follows the "One Connection" rule, tenants can use the app to ensure their usage stays within the limits agreed upon with the landlord or to track their specific share of a bill.
* **Budgeting:** It converts "kWh" (a technical term) into "Rupees" (a practical term) every single day, helping families manage their monthly expenses better.
* **Energy Conservation:** The visual feedback of seeing a "Zero Bill" turn into a "Paid Bill" encourages users to switch off unnecessary lights and fans.
